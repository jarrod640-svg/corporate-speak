## Step 5: Set Up Webhooks (Advanced - Optional)

For automatic subscription management when users cancel/upgrade:

1. Stripe Dashboard â†’ **Developers** â†’ **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. Endpoint URL: `https://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Select events to listen to:
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

5. Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

6. Create `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.js`:

```javascript
import { headers } from 'next/headers';
import Stripe from 'stripe';

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
const webhookSecret = process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

export async function POST(req) {
  const body = await req.text();
  const signature = headers().get('stripe-signature');

  let event;

  try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, signature, webhookSecret);
  } catch (err) {
    return new Response(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`, { status: 400 });
  }

  // Handle the event
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'customer.subscription.created':
    case 'customer.subscription.updated':
      // Activate premium for user
      const subscription = event.data.object;
      console.log('Subscription updated:', subscription.id);
      break;

    case 'customer.subscription.deleted':
      // Deactivate premium for user
      const deletedSub = event.data.object;
      console.log('Subscription cancelled:', deletedSub.id);
      break;

    case 'invoice.payment_failed':
      // Send email reminder
      const failedInvoice = event.data.object;
      console.log('Payment failed:', failedInvoice.id);
      break;
  }

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ received: true }), { status: 200 });
}
```

7. Add to `.env.local`:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_here
```

### Activate Your Account

1. Stripe Dashboard â†’ Click **Activate your account**
2. Provide:

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Solution:**
1. Check that they clicked through to `/success` page
2. Verify localStorage has `premium_subscription` key
3. For long-term solution, implement webhooks

### Issue: Test mode payments work, live mode doesn't
**Solution:**
1. Verify you've switched to Live mode in dashboard
2. Update payment links to Live links (no `test_` in URL)
3. Check environment variables are using Live keys

### Issue: Customer wants refund
**Solution:**
1. Stripe Dashboard â†’ Payments â†’ Find transaction
2. Click **Refund**

## Security Best Practices

### Never commit API keys
```
# .gitignore (already set up)
.env.local
.env
```

### Use environment variables
```
# .env.local
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

### Verify webhook signatures
Always verify signatures in webhook handlers (see webhook example above)

### HTTPS only
- Vercel provides free HTTPS
- Never use Stripe on HTTP
