🎩 Professional Development Tool Alert

After years of corporate meetings, I've learned that HOW you say something is often more important than WHAT you say.

That's why I built Corporate Speak Generator - a tool that helps you:

The AI Voice Translator feature is particularly useful for presentation prep - speak naturally and hear how it sounds in "corporate."

## Response Templates

### For "Why did you build this?"
> "Great question! I was in a meeting where someone said 'let's circle back to synergize our bandwidth' with a straight face. I realized corporate speak is everywhere, and instead of complaining about it, I wanted to make it actually useful (and fun!). Plus, the voice mode is genuinely helpful for practicing presentations."

### For "What's next?"
> "Working on: Chrome extension for LinkedIn, Slack integration for teams, and custom buzzword dictionaries. What would you use most?"

### For "How is this different from ChatGPT?"
> "ChatGPT is amazing but overkill for this specific use case. We're focused, fast, and fun. Plus our voice mode is unique - speak naturally and hear corporate jargon instantly. No prompting needed!"

### For pricing questions
> "Free tier is 5 generations/day (generous for testing). Pro is $4.99/month (unlimited + voice mode). Most users find free sufficient, but pros love the voice feature for presentation practice."
